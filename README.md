Abstractâ€”As popularity and media attention of unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) increases government regulations via the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) are continuing to change

in order to keep people and facilities safe from malicious in-
tentions. While one attack vector is to focus on WiFi access

to compromise video streams and flight controls we explore an
attack vector of compromising the radio frequency (RF) signals
transmitted from the drones controller. We evaluate the difficulty
and environment required to compromise the video stream and
flight controls of an affordable and popular commercial drone.
By sniffing and reconstructing the controllers implementation of
Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS), we propose a
method to obtain a completed frequency hopping table of any
drone, allowing a user to track and spoof flight controls to a
targeted drone.
